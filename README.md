## Introduction
__The Graph__ is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying data from blockchains, starting with Ethereum. We currently have __*four*__ different Smart Contracts and each of them emit some specific events with valuable information based on the various methods. We have used The Graph to map the data from these events and store them at the Graph’s hosted service. 

## Our Learnings
- We have learnt from our previous projects how hard and slow it could be to query data on decentralized web, hence we use The graph in almost every place in the frontend where we have to fetch data quickly and show the results. 
- The Graph also quickly maps out the data for us and is instantaneously available after a transaction takes place which is a huge help in making the web app feel real time. 
- Another great thing that we have come to appreciate about the Graph is that it not only lets you map data but structure it as well as according to our requirements in the form of entities and we were able to form relations between various entities and use that to our advantage as well.

## Conclusion
The Graph felt very snappy and helped us increase the speed of our web app by vast margins and helped us structure data in a way that wasn’t previously possible normally on decentralized web helping in reducing the complexity of our frontend.
